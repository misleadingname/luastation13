# Lua Station 13
###### A BYONDless remake of the classic, satanist, DreamSMP, award-winning space game [Space Station 13](https://spacestation13.com).
(Currently inspired mostly by [/tg/station 13](https://tgstation13.org))

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Lua Station 13 (LS13) is still in early development. There’s no station, characters, or gameplay yet.
> Contributions, ideas, and feedback are always welcome.

> [!NOTE]
> LS13 uses a fork of LÖVE called [RobustLÖVE](https://github.com/misleadingname/robustlove/), this was done to add language support and improve security. Robust Toolbox style!

## Prerequisites
- [RobustLÖVE](https://github.com/misleadingname/robustlove/) 12.0 or newer
- [Lua BitOp](https://bitop.luajit.org/)

## Running Scripts
Some utility scripts use PowerShell.
Make sure you have **PowerShell 7+** installed to run them properly.

## Building
When building the project:
- Copy any third-party libraries into the project root.
- Add them to both `ExtraFiles` and `DoNotPack` entries as needed.

### *Work in Progress!*
Things are moving, just slowly. :)
